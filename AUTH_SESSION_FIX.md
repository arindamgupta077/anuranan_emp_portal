# Authentication Session Fix for Netlify Deployment

## Problem Description
Users logging into the Netlify-deployed application were all accessing the CEO's account instead of their own profiles. This was caused by improper cookie handling and session management on Netlify.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Cookie Configuration Issues**
- Cookies were not being set with proper attributes for production environments
- Missing `sameSite`, `secure`, and `path` attributes
- Netlify's edge network requires specific cookie configurations

### 2. **Caching Problems**
- Authenticated pages were being cached by Netlify's CDN
- User-specific content was being served to all users
- Missing cache-control headers for dynamic routes

### 3. **Session Persistence**
- Sessions weren't being properly cleared between logins
- Stale authentication data was being reused

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Updated Server-Side Supabase Client** (`src/lib/supabase/server.ts`)
```typescript
// Added proper cookie attributes
cookieStore.set({ 
  name, 
  value, 
  ...options,
  sameSite: 'lax',
  secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
  path: '/',
})
```

**Why this fixes it:**
- `sameSite: 'lax'` allows cookies to be sent on top-level navigation
- `secure: true` (in production) ensures cookies only sent over HTTPS
- `path: '/'` ensures cookies are accessible across all routes

### 2. **Enhanced Middleware** (`src/middleware.ts`)
```typescript
// Added cache-control headers to prevent caching
response.headers.set('Cache-Control', 'private, no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate')
response.headers.set('Pragma', 'no-cache')
response.headers.set('Expires', '0')
```

**Why this fixes it:**
- Prevents Netlify from caching authenticated responses
- Forces fresh data on every request
- Ensures user-specific content isn't served to other users

### 3. **Updated Login Flow** (`src/app/login/page.tsx`)
```typescript
// Clear existing session before login
await supabase.auth.signOut()
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100))

// Clear cached data after successful login
sessionStorage.clear()
localStorage.removeItem('supabase.auth.token')
```

**Why this fixes it:**
- Ensures no stale session data from previous logins
- Prevents session overlap between users
- Forces a clean authentication state

### 4. **Netlify Configuration** (`netlify.toml`)
Added cache-control headers for all authenticated routes:
```toml
[[headers]]
  for = "/dashboard/*"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "private, no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate"
```

**Why this fixes it:**
- Netlify-level configuration prevents CDN caching
- Applies to all authenticated routes
- Works in conjunction with middleware headers

### 5. **Next.js Configuration** (`next.config.js`)
```javascript
{
  source: '/(dashboard|admin|tasks|self-tasks|leaves|profile|reports)/:path*',
  headers: [
    {
      key: 'Cache-Control',
      value: 'private, no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate'
    },
  ],
}
```

**Why this fixes it:**
- Application-level cache control
- Ensures Next.js doesn't cache authenticated pages
- Multiple layers of protection against caching

### 6. **Added Debug Logging**
Added console logs to track:
- User ID during login
- Auth user ID on dashboard load
- Database query results
- Role information

**Why this helps:**
- Allows debugging in production
- Helps identify if the issue persists
- Provides visibility into the authentication flow

## Testing the Fix

### Before Deploying to Netlify:

1. **Test Locally:**
```powershell
npm run build
npm run start
```

2. **Test Multiple User Logins:**
   - Login with User A
   - Check dashboard shows User A's data
   - Logout
   - Login with User B
   - Verify dashboard shows User B's data (NOT User A)

3. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Look for the debug logs showing correct user IDs
   - Verify no auth errors

### After Deploying to Netlify:

1. **Clear Netlify Cache:**
```powershell
# In Netlify dashboard: Site Configuration > Build & Deploy > Clear cache and deploy site
```

2. **Test with Multiple Users:**
   - Open site in incognito window
   - Login with different users in different browsers/devices
   - Verify each user sees their own data

3. **Check Network Tab:**
   - Verify cookies are being set correctly
   - Check cache-control headers are present
   - Ensure no 304 (cached) responses for authenticated pages

## Environment Variables to Verify on Netlify

Make sure these are set correctly in Netlify:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Your Supabase anonymous key

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. **Session Timeout**
Consider adding session timeout handling in middleware:
```typescript
const session = await supabase.auth.getSession()
if (session.data.session) {
  const expiresAt = new Date(session.data.session.expires_at * 1000)
  if (expiresAt < new Date()) {
    // Session expired, redirect to login
  }
}
```

### 2. **Rate Limiting**
Add rate limiting to login endpoint to prevent brute force attacks

### 3. **Monitoring**
Set up monitoring to track:
- Failed login attempts
- Session creation/destruction
- User switching patterns

## Rollback Plan

If issues persist:
1. Revert to previous deployment in Netlify
2. Check Supabase Auth settings (URL, JWT settings)
3. Verify database RLS policies aren't causing conflicts
4. Check for any browser extensions interfering with cookies

## Expected Behavior After Fix

✅ Each user sees only their own data
✅ Login redirects to correct user's dashboard
✅ Role-based permissions work correctly
✅ No cross-user data leakage
✅ Logout clears session completely
✅ Fresh login creates new session

## Files Modified

1. `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` - Cookie configuration
2. `src/middleware.ts` - Cache headers and cookie handling
3. `src/app/login/page.tsx` - Session cleanup
4. `netlify.toml` - CDN cache configuration
5. `next.config.js` - Application cache configuration
6. `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Debug logging

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit Changes:**
```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Resolve authentication session issues on Netlify"
git push origin main
```

2. **Netlify Auto-Deploy:**
   - Wait for Netlify to build and deploy
   - Check deploy logs for any errors

3. **Clear Netlify Cache:**
   - Go to Netlify dashboard
   - Site Configuration > Build & Deploy
   - Click "Clear cache and deploy site"

4. **Test Thoroughly:**
   - Test with multiple users
   - Test in different browsers
   - Test on different devices

## Contact & Support

If issues persist after applying these fixes:
1. Check Netlify deploy logs
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify Supabase Auth logs
4. Check RLS policies in Supabase
